# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a robust, scalable, and maintainable backend and frontend architecture for the AI Interview Assistant application. The system must ensure logical connectivity between all components, eliminate breaking code scenarios, and provide a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Glossary

- **AI_Interview_System**: The complete application including frontend, backend APIs, database, and AI integration components
- **Authentication_Service**: The user authentication and authorization subsystem handling login, registration, and session management
- **Interview_Engine**: The core component managing interview sessions, question generation, and answer processing
- **Candidate_Management_System**: The subsystem handling candidate profiles, resume processing, and scoring
- **API_Gateway**: The unified entry point for all client-server communications with consistent error handling and validation
- **Database_Layer**: The data persistence layer using Prisma ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Frontend_Client**: The Next.js React application providing the user interface
- **State_Management_System**: The Redux-based state management with persistence capabilities
- **File_Processing_Service**: The service handling resume uploads, parsing, and AI analysis
- **Real_Time_Communication**: The system enabling live updates and notifications between interviewer and interviewee

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust backend architecture that prevents breaking changes, so that the application remains stable during development and deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL implement comprehensive error handling with standardized error responses across all API endpoints
2. THE API_Gateway SHALL validate all incoming requests using Zod schemas before processing
3. THE Database_Layer SHALL use database transactions for all multi-step operations to ensure data consistency
4. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL implement graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
5. THE Authentication_Service SHALL handle token expiration and refresh scenarios without breaking user sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured codebase with clear separation of concerns, so that I can maintain and extend the system without introducing bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL organize code into distinct layers: presentation, business logic, data access, and external integrations
2. THE API_Gateway SHALL implement consistent request/response patterns across all endpoints
3. THE Database_Layer SHALL use repository pattern to abstract database operations from business logic
4. THE Frontend_Client SHALL implement component composition patterns to ensure reusability and maintainability
5. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL enforce TypeScript strict mode across all modules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless data flow between frontend and backend, so that my actions are reflected immediately without inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE State_Management_System SHALL synchronize client state with server state using optimistic updates
2. THE API_Gateway SHALL implement proper HTTP status codes and error messages for all operations
3. THE Frontend_Client SHALL handle loading states and error conditions gracefully
4. THE Real_Time_Communication SHALL provide instant updates for interview session changes
5. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL maintain data consistency between concurrent user sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want reliable file processing capabilities, so that resume uploads and analysis work consistently without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE File_Processing_Service SHALL support multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX) with fallback parsing methods
2. THE File_Processing_Service SHALL implement retry mechanisms for failed AI analysis requests
3. THE Database_Layer SHALL store file metadata and processing status for audit trails
4. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL handle large file uploads with progress indicators and timeout handling
5. THE File_Processing_Service SHALL validate file integrity before processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an interviewer or interviewee, I want a responsive and intuitive user interface, so that I can focus on the interview process without technical distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_Client SHALL implement responsive design patterns for all screen sizes
2. THE Frontend_Client SHALL provide immediate feedback for all user interactions
3. THE State_Management_System SHALL persist user preferences and session data locally
4. THE Frontend_Client SHALL implement keyboard navigation and accessibility features
5. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL maintain UI state consistency during network interruptions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL log all API requests with correlation IDs for tracing
2. THE Database_Layer SHALL log all database operations with execution times
3. THE Authentication_Service SHALL audit all authentication attempts and session changes
4. THE Interview_Engine SHALL track interview session progress and completion metrics
5. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL implement health check endpoints for monitoring system status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing coverage, so that I can deploy changes confidently without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL maintain unit test coverage above 80% for business logic components
2. THE API_Gateway SHALL include integration tests for all endpoint scenarios
3. THE Frontend_Client SHALL implement component testing for critical user flows
4. THE Database_Layer SHALL include tests for all repository operations and edge cases
5. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL run end-to-end tests covering complete user journeys

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want scalable architecture patterns, so that the system can handle increased load and feature additions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
2. THE API_Gateway SHALL support rate limiting and request throttling
3. THE Database_Layer SHALL optimize queries and implement proper indexing strategies
4. THE Interview_Engine SHALL handle concurrent interview sessions efficiently
5. THE AI_Interview_System SHALL support horizontal scaling through stateless service design
